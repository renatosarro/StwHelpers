# StwHelpers
The idea behind this lib is to join a collection of utilities to help you simplify your project making it cleaner.
#
To this first commit, let's begin with something small, like a sort array - for example.
#
Hope you can join this and make it to growing with more and more libs =)

# Pod

Podfile
```
pod "StwHelpers"
```

Terminal
```
pod install
```

# NSArray - Order by
Our first collection is a NSArray Category with a simple method that enables you sort your list in a simple and easy way.
#
The codes below sorts a list of Strings - ascending and descneding.
